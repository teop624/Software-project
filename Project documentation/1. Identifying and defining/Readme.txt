I will be programming a library book management system pwa, and securing it it with secure software architcture.
The app will be able to search a database for books, lend books with a binary status for availability, allow books to be. added and removed from the database and use logins. 
I will use a hashing algorithm to protect the login information of users, session management and 2FA to protect against compromised passwords.
I will use a tool known as OWASP ZAP for penetration testing and detect common vulnerabilities and program countermeasures.
The database will use SQLite 3 because it is a well known tool for its simplicity and reliability.
I also would like to add css if i have time to make my program look better and not like a windows vista 2006 trashcan
